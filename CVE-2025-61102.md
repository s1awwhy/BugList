# CVE-2025-61102: NULL Pointer Dereference in FRRouting

FRRouting/frr from v4.0 through v10.4.1 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference via the `show_vty_ext_link_adj_sid` function at `ospf_ext.c`. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted OSPF packet.

## Product Information
- **Product**: FRRouting  
- **Affected Version**: from 4.0 through 10.4.1  
- **Download Source**: [https://github.com/FRRouting/frr](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr)  
- **Vulnerability Type**: NULL Pointer Dereference  

## Description
A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `show_vty_ext_link_adj_sid` function within `ospf_ext.c`.  
When the OSPF daemon (`ospfd`) is configured with the debug command `debug ospf packet all send/recv detail`, it attempts to display detailed information for OSPF packets. Under certain malformed OSPF packet conditions, this function may dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash of the OSPF process.  
An attacker can remotely trigger this issue by sending a specially crafted OSPF packet, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) when debugging is enabled.

## Impact
- **Attack Type**: Remote  
- **Impact: Denial of Service (DoS)**: True  
- **Attack Vector**: Requires the victim to enable `debug ospf packet all send/recv detail` in configuration.
