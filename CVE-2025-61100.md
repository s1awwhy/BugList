# CVE-2025-61100: NULL Pointer Dereference in FRRouting

FRRouting/frr from v2.0 through v10.4.1 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference via the `ospf_opaque_lsa_dump` function at `ospf_opaque.c`. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) under specific malformed LSA conditions.

## Product Information
- **Product**: FRRouting
- **Affected Version**: from 2.0 through 10.4.1
- **Download Source**: [https://github.com/FRRouting/frr](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr)
- **Vulnerability Type**: NULL Pointer Dereference

## Description
A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `ospf_opaque_lsa_dump` function within `ospf_opaque.c`.  
When the OSPF daemon (`ospfd`) has the debug command `debug ospf packet all send/recv detail` enabled, it attempts to dump detailed information for received or sent OSPF packets. Under specific malformed LSA conditions, the function may dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash of the OSPF process and resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  
Attackers can remotely trigger this issue by sending a specially crafted LSA when the debugging option is active.

## Impact
- **Attack Type**: Remote  
- **Impact: Denial of Service (DoS)**: True  
- **Attack Vector**: Requires the victim to enable `debug ospf packet all send/recv detail` in configuration.
